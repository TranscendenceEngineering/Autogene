# Autogene
An open source tool for whole genome editing

Autogene is an open source Java toolkit for gene editing. The aim of the project is to create an open source algorithm and usable software for automated epi/genetic editing capable of:
1. Automatically design sgRNAs for CRISPR epi/genetic editing given a list pointwise mutations that are needed
2. Computationally-efficiently evaluate the off-target activity of a given sgRNA given a whole genome
3. Automatically choose, among the possible sgRNA capable of performing a pointwise mutation, the one that minimise the risk of off-target activity
